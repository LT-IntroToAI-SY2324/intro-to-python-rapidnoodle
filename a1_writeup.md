# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I like that Python uses common English words for most of its syntax so it is easy to learn and understand at a beginner level. In
comparison to Java, it feels a lot cleaner to write instead of having to write a lot of boilerplate code. This makes writing code
efficient and more fun!

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Like I said in #1, the syntax in Python uses a lot of English words, which is different from classical languages that require type
definition for each variable. Also, they use && and || symbols for what you would use 'and' and 'or' in Python, which is more
intuitive. I have heard that Python runs a bit slower because of the implicit type declaration, but for these simple programs, it
is hardly noticable.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

The most important think I learned how to do was how to think like a programmer. In order to solve coding problems, you need to put
yourself into the shoes of the computer and run through the code in your head as you write it. The more depth you can visualize your
code, the easier it is to write (with less bugs too). Another thing I learned was more of the Python syntax because I know other
programming languages, so it was cool to see what Python was like to compare.
